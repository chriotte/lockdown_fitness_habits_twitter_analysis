# Quantifying Londoners change in fitness habits during lockdown

With people being urged to stay at home, gyms closed, and social distancing measures in place, it's safe to say that fitness and workout trends have changed along with other aspects of daily life.

See the blog post @ dataespresso.com for a full description, and a link to the dataset.
