With people being urged to stay at home during the Covid-19 outbreak, gyms closed, and social distancing measures in place, itâ€™s safe to say that fitness and workout trends have changed along with other aspects of daily life. Using data from Twitter, we set out to investigate the popularity of certain fitness-related keywords, before and during the UK lockdown that started on the 23rd of March 2020, to see if we can uncover Londoners exercise trends.
